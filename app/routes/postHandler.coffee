# PostHandler
# =======
#
# **PostHandler** uses the [async](https://github.com/caolan/async) module
# for handling all incoming POST requests. POST requests trigger the server to execute
# the requested method. Executing a method consists of several steps:
# 1. extract the submitted image
# 2. match the recieved parameters to the requested parameters as defined in services.json
# 3. try to load the results from disk. If results are found, immediately return them
# 4. If no results found, build the command for the commmand line callback
# 5. Save the results
# 6. return the results
#
# These steps are performed using (async > waterfall)[https://github.com/caolan/async#waterfall]
# to ensure ordered execution.
